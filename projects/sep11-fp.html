            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP11 Freedom Project Project</h1>
            <p>In this long years, I made this platformer game using what I learned  aboit Kaboom, to akke this webiste.</p>
            <p>In the beginning we have learned a lot of about so many things we can make using Javascript. Later I found that kaboom is a tool to make with my platformer game with, so I wanted to make a platformer game. I wanted to experience how to build the plateformer games are like and the process of making somethung.</p>
            <p><u>Context</u>:The “Freedom Project” for SEP11 is all about my experience using kaboom and creating a platformer game using the knowledge I gained. I would like to experience what the developers of mario went through but using the knowledge that I gained from kaboom. The purpose of this blog is to track my experiences, challenges, and my progress on what I learned with kaboom.js, and making my project.</p>
           <p><u>Content</u>: For my project, I am making a platform video game. This blog will walk through my process of studying kaboom.js in order to make a platformer video game, something similar to Mario.</p>
            <p><u>Reflection</u>: After all my hardwork from picking and learning my tool making sprites and building my game, we finally got to show off my final product, in the showcase and during in class presentations. I receive my feedback from Mr.Mueller, I noticed that my idea of trying to make something similar to a mario game is not original enough. I understand what I did wrong there because the game can be similar to copying another game, meaning it's kind of plagiarism. Some presentation feedback Mr.Mueller gave me was that I would say unnecessary words such as, “I forgot whatI was going to say”, when I could've taken a moment to collect my ideas and what I was thinking before saying what I needed to say. I also needed to make more eye contact with the audience. Another thing is to make all my slides match what I’m saying so it isn’t confusing to the audience. Takeaways during the expo, we had limited time because me and my partner, Grace, didn't see each other that often. So when we got to the expo, we quickly rehearsed what we had even though it wasn't the best, we made some changes to make it presentable for our audience. In this case communication is very important especially when we aren't together. In the end, the lessons we learned from giving our presentation at the expo and in class have helped us remember certain details that we will need to watch out for in future presentations. Even though I was really anxious about giving a presentation in front of everyone, it wasn't as terrifying as I thought it would be. I enjoyed it and thought Grace and I were happy with our presentation, even though there were definitely areas for improvement.</p>
